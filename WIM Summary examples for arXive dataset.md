we first identify and classify the large - scale environment , then we determine whether a given halo resides in a filament or sheet , and finally we try to find correlations between the halo spin and shape orientations and their large - scale environment .    up to the present day , a number of different approaches have been suggested to find filaments ( and/or sheets ) in simulations as well as in observations . among these methods. pimbblet ( 2005 ) searched the 2df galaxy redshift survey catalog for filamentary structures using the orientations of inter - cluster galaxies . a related approach based on the inter - cluster dark matter distribution derived from n - body simulations. the cosmological parameters used in the simulation are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . in the upper - left panel of fig .. associated with each segment , there are two node halos , one of which is the most massive one among all the associated halos .. [ major_masstop ] , we show the alignment signals for halos in segments with most massive halos in four mass bins ( note that this can only be done for method slowromancap2@ ) .. this alignment strength is in very good agreement with that obtained by aragn - calvo et al .. we first rank all the ( member ) halos within the filaments according to the cosine of their angles between the major axes and the filament directions , @xmath128 , here we use @xmath129 to represent the angle between the major axis and the filament directions . ] .. hahn et al .  ( 2007b ) applied a hessian matrix approach to the gravitational potential field ( instead of the density field ) , and also found an opposite mass dependence for the alignment strengths of spin- and shape - filament alignments .

**Article abstract:**
clusters , filaments , sheets and voids are the building blocks of the cosmic web .. forming dark matter halos respond to these different large - scale environments , and this in turn affects the properties of galaxies hosted by the halos .. it is therefore important to understand the systematic correlations of halo properties with the morphology of the cosmic web , as this informs both about galaxy formation physics and possible systematics of weak lensing studies . in this study. , we present and compare two distinct algorithms for finding cosmic filaments and sheets , a task which is far less well established than the identification of dark matter halos or voids .. one method is based on the smoothed dark matter density field , the other uses the halo distributions directly .. we apply both techniques to one high resolution n - body simulation and reconstruct the filamentary / sheet like network of the dark matter density field .. we focus on investigating the properties of the dark matter halos inside these structures , in particular on the directions of their spins and the orientation of their shapes with respect to the directions of the filaments and sheets .. we find that both the spin and the major axes of filament - halos with masses @xmath0 are preferentially aligned with the direction of the filaments .. the spins and major axes of halos in sheets tend to lie parallel to the sheets .. there is an opposite mass dependence of the alignment strengths for the spin ( negative ) and major ( positive ) axes , i.e. with increasing halo mass the major axis tends to be more strongly aligned with the direction of the filament whereas the alignment between halo spin and filament becomes weaker with increasing halo mass .. the alignment strengths as a function of distance to the most massive node halo indicate that there is a transit large scale environment impact : from the 2-d collapse phase of the filament to the 3-d collapse phase of the cluster / node halo at small separation .. overall , the two algorithms for filament / sheet identification investigated here agree well with each other .. the method based on halos alone can be easily adapted for use with observational data sets .

**Generated summary:**
authors of the work @xcite phenomenologically interpret their data by assigning two different diffusion constants for the two separate experiments in which the same dna is placed in the channel in two possible orientations .. indeed , for free diffusion , the friction coefficient ( averaged over the scale well exceeding a single base ) moving in one direction and in the opposite direction must be the same , as follows from the onsager symmetry relation , and the assumption of asymmetric friction would be a grave mistake . although no one actually made this mistake , including @xcite , it is worth emphasizing why an assumption of asymmetric friction would be a mistake . indeed , if we only imagine that dna ( not driven by any applied voltage ! ) diffuses in one direction faster than in the other , then we can easily build a _. ( note that since we know very little about the details of the interactions between the dna bases and the pore , we can not determine if case a in figure [ fig : sawtooth ] corresponds to case 1a in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] , and case b in figure [ fig : sawtooth ] corresponds to case 1b in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] , or if it is the other way around . )    since dna translocation is ultimately not classical diffusion , but rather subdiffusion @xcite , we consider also the first passage times for the subdiffusion in the presence of an asymmetric potential . in general , the first passage time for subdiffusion was recently a matter of considerable interest and dispute in the literature @xcite .. the solution of this differential equation for a sawtooth potential @xmath15 is outlined in appendix [ sec : solution ] . for the particle initially located at the origin ( @xmath34 ) , the mean first passage time to reach @xmath22. conditional _ probability distribution of the first passage events that get counted under such a protocol is then given by @xmath64 for such an experiment , there exists a perfectly defined and finite average first passage time .. , we expect a long time interval in which the behaviour of the mittag - leffler function @xmath115 behaves like an exponential ; at much longer times the behaviour changes to a power law . the crossover is expected to happen when @xmath116 , or at about @xmath117 .. after some algebra one obtains @xmath121\end{aligned}\ ] ] or @xmath122\end{aligned}\ ] ] for @xmath57 , corresponding to classical diffusion , the survival probability @xmath123 decays exponentially and the term with the integral goes to zero , yielding the familiar result of @xmath124 for the right - hand - side @xcite . for @xmath125 , @xmath123 goes like @xmath126 ( see ( [ s - series ] ) ) and the term with the integral goes like @xmath127 .. limit , using ( [ eigensol ] ) and ( [ mittaglimit ] ) ,    @xmath149    @xmath150    @xmath151    again , these results indicate that the mfpt diverges for @xmath125 .

**Article abstract:**
motivated by experiments in which single - stranded dna with a short hairpin loop at one end undergoes unforced diffusion through a narrow pore , we study the first passage times for a particle , executing one - dimensional brownian motion in an asymmetric sawtooth potential , to exit one of the boundaries .. we consider the first passage times for the case of classical diffusion , characterized by a mean - square displacement of the form @xmath0 , and for the case of anomalous diffusion or subdiffusion , characterized by a mean - square displacement of the form @xmath1 with @xmath2 . in the context of classical diffusion ,. we obtain an expression for the mean first passage time and show that this quantity changes when the direction of the sawtooth is reversed or , equivalently , when the reflecting and absorbing boundaries are exchanged .. we discuss at which numbers of ` teeth ' @xmath3 ( or number of dna nucleotides ) and at which heights of the sawtooth potential this difference becomes significant . for large @xmath3. , it is well known that the mean first passage time scales as @xmath4 . in the context of subdiffusion , the mean first passage time. does not exist .. therefore we obtain instead the distribution of first passage times in the limit of long times .. we show that the prefactor in the power relation for this distribution is simply the expression for the mean first passage time in classical diffusion .. we also describe a hypothetical experiment to calculate the average of the first passage times for a fraction of passage events that each end within some time @xmath5 .. we show that this average first passage time scales as @xmath6 in subdiffusion .

on the right picture we depicted the self - intersection and break down of loop of the length @xmath0 into two daughter loops with lengths @xmath10 and @xmath11 the rates of these processes are characterized by the rate coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath6 correspondingly.it is widely appreciated that the `` recombination '' processes greatly influence both the structure and dynamics of the vortex tangle .. the feynman s idea was confirmed in various numerical calculations , where the procedure of artificial elimination of small loops had been used @xcite-@xcite .        to clarify the role of recombination , let us perform the following numerical estimation .. there are two mechanisms for change of @xmath39 the first one is the mentioned above deterministic process of evolution of elements of the individual loops , during which they move undergo the stretching or shrinking .. let us consider function @xmath47which is the vector connecting points @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( see fig .. this enables us to express the net flux @xmath158 ( [ flux ] ) via quantity @xmath14 . substituting ( vld_vs_curvature ) into relation for the net flux ( [ flux ] ) we arrive at conclusion that both the positive constituent @xmath142 and the negative one @xmath159 are proportional to the squared vortex line density @xmath160 in unsteady case at finite temperature quantities @xmath142 and @xmath143 do not compensate each other , so the net flux @xmath141 does not vanish and it is also proportional to the squared vortex line density @xmath160 that means that the rate of decay of quantity @xmath125 due to fluxes carrying away the length from the system can be written as @xmath161relation ( [ ve ] ) is the particular case of the so - called vinen equation discussed in detail in the next subsection .. if we take all terms in collision integral with the plus sign and use for estimation our solution for @xmath1 we obtain the total number of reconnections .. the distant parts @xmath219 are separated in @xmath217 space by the distance @xmath220 , i.e. the vortex loop has the typical random walk structure . the scale @xmath221 is depicted here in the left upper corner.,width=264 ]    the average loop can be imagined as consisting of many arches with the mean radius of curvature equal @xmath35 randomly ( but smoothly ) connected to each other .. the presence of counterflow velocity violates an assumptions of the isotrpic wiener distribution used in previous sections .

**Article abstract:**
a theory is developed to describe the superfluid turbulence on the base of kinetics of the merging and splitting vortex loops . because of very frequent reconnections the vortex loops ( as a whole ) do not live long enough to perform any essential evolution due to the deterministic motion . on the contrary , they rapidly merge and split , and these random recombination processes prevail over other slower dynamic processes . to develop quantitative description we take the vortex loops to have a brownian structure with the only degree of freedom , which is the length @xmath0 of the loop .. we perform investigation on the base of the boltzmann type kinetic equation  for the distribution function @xmath1 of number of loops with length @xmath0 .. this equation describes a slow change of the density of loops ( in space of their lengths @xmath0 ) due to the deterministic equation of motion and due to fast random change because of the frequent reconnections . by use of the special ansatz in the collision . integral we have found the exact power - like solution @xmath2 to kinetic equation  in the stationary case .. this solution is not ( thermodynamically ) equilibrium , but on the contrary , it describes the state with two mutual fluxes of the length ( or energy ) in space of sizes of the vortex loops .. the term flux  means just redistribution of length ( or energy ) among the loops of different sizes due to reconnections .. analyzing this solution we drew several results on the structure and dynamics of the vortex tangle in the turbulent  superfluid helium .. in particular , we obtained that the mean radius of the curvature is of the order of interline space .. we also evaluated the full rate of the reconnection events . assuming , further , that the processes of random collisions are the fastest ones , we studied the evolution of full length of vortex loops per unit volume - the so - called vortex line density @xmath3 .. it is shown this evolution to obey the famous vinen equation .. the properties of the vinen equation from the point of view of the developed approach had been discussed .. thus , depending on the temperature ( and independently on velocity ) vortices either develop into the highly chaotic turbulent state ( low temperature ) , or degenerate into few smooth lines ( high temperature ) .. this observation can be an alternative explanation for the phenomenon discovered in helsinki group ( nature 424 , 10221025 ( 2003)).pacs - numbers : 67.25.dk , 47.37.+q , 05.20.-y

using the derived mean ridge lines , we performed ms@xmath4 and rgb@xmath4fitting between each cluster in each metallicity group and the corresponding reference cluster . figure  [ msfexample ] shows examples of the fitting , in which the mean ridge lines of clusters with @xmath23_{\rm cg } < -1.1 $ ] ( solid lines ) have been shifted in both magnitude and color to fit the reference cluster , ngc 6981 ( dashed line ) .. in particular , d07 isochrones with similar metallicity and different ages were superimposed on the same cmd . based on visual inspection , these two particular regions were found to have little dependence upon cluster age , and were adopted as the optimum intervals for the ms fitting procedure .. typical values of @xmath48 are in the interval @xmath50.01 - 0.06 mag .    to estimate the uncertainties induced by differential reddening , binary star population , and total number of cluster stars , as well as by differences between the measured msto and the actual ggc s msto , we generated over 250 synthetic cmds using the iac@xmath4star @xcite synthetic cmd program .. the effect that this @xmath65 0.05 dex uncertainty has on the final relative ages will be discussed at the end of this section .. is measured for each ggcs in our database , and then obtained magnitudes are transformed into ages using a set of theoretical stellar evolution models . during this transformation ,. it is worth mentioning that while the age@xmath4metallicity relation may be model dependent ( though it is somehow reassuring that the four most recent theoretical libraries provide consistent results on this respect ) the age dispersion@xmath4metallicity relation is not model dependent . from now on. a more detailed analysis is necessary , but it is important to note that any successful galaxy formation scenario must account for the existence of a large nubmer of old , coeval globular clusters in the milky way .. on the other hand if the young group is taken into account , it can be seen that the age s variance increases with galactocentric distance . in order to determine if this variance increase depends either on the galactocentric distance or the metallicity , a three dimensional principal@xmath4component ( pc )

the acs survey of galactic globular clusters is a @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 treasury program designed to provide a new large , deep and homogeneous photometric database .. based on observations from this program , we have measured precise relative ages for a sample of 64 galactic globular clusters by comparing the relative position of the clusters main sequence turn offs , using main@xmath4sequence fitting to cross@xmath4compare clusters within the sample .. this method provides relative ages to a formal precision of 2 - 7% .. we demonstrate that the calculated relative ages are independent of the choice of theoretical model .. we find that the galactic globular cluster sample can be divided into two groups  a population of old clusters with an age dispersion of @xmath55% and no age@xmath4metallicity relation , and a group of younger clusters with an age@xmath4metallicity relation similar to that of the globular clusters associated with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy .   . these results are consistent with the milky way halo having formed in two phases or processes. . the first one would be compatible with a rapid ( @xmath60.8 gyr ) assembling process of the halo , in which the clusters in the old group were formed .. also these clusters could have been formed before reionization in dwarf galaxies that would later merge to build the milky way halo as predicted by @xmath7cdm cosmology .. however , the galactocentric metallicity gradient shown by these clusters seems difficult to reconcile with the latter . as for the younger clusters ,. it is very tempting to argue that their origin is related to their formation within milky way satellite galaxies that were later accreted , but the origin of the age@xmath4metallicity relation remains unclear .
