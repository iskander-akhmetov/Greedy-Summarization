SECTION I.Introduction In this paper, we start with the challenging question, whether there is room for the development of extractive summarization methods? Or, did they become obsolete and need to be replaced by more modern abstractive summarization methods? In addition, the question that naturally arises is: what maximum quality of a summary can we achieve with extractive summarization methods?  Automatic text summarization (ATS) is a process of extracting the essential information from a textThis type of summary resembles bullet points to anchor for the main in-formation and often lacks transitive phrases and sentences for smoothing the text Purpose  Generic summaries have no focus on the special needs of any particular group of users and suit the wide public on average Proposed in 2004, a stochastic graph-based Extractive Summarization method that computes relative importance of textual units similar to the famous PageRank [14] algorithm used early by Google in ranking web pagesThe basic idea of the metric is based on counting the number of verbal and/or phrase matches, also known as n-grams, between the generated graded summary and the excellent human-made gold standardData The arXive dataset, firstly introduced along with the PubMed dataset in 2018 [18], contains 215K arXiv.org repository scientific articles in English from the domains of physics, math, and other quantitative fieldsSS=Z2∗(p)∗(1−p)c2,(4) View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.where, Z is the Z-score (for example 1.96 for the 95% confidence probability or precision), p is the probability with which any item from the population can be selected (0.5 by default), c is the confidence interval in decimal formDn,m=supx∣F1,n(x)−F2,m(x)∣,(6) View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.where F1,n and F2,m are the empirical distribution functions, and n and m are the sizes of the first and the second sample respectively, and sup is the supremum function (shortly, a number form a set which is greater than or equal to any number of a sets subset, if such a number exists [25])Some statistics can be collected quickly and easily (ex., text lengths), but others require tedious tests and trial routines requiring computational resources and time (exThus, generally, we can say that Extractive Methods of Summarization still have the potential for development, supporting the opinion of Sebastian Ruder when he says that the significant role is played not by the complexity of the method but by proper hyper-parameter tuning and data preprocessing [38]
